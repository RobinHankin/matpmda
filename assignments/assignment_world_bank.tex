\newpage
\noindent
This assignment will follow the statistical enquiry cycle discussed in
lectures.  Your analysis should be written as a report (2-4 pages of
A4 is about right) and should follow the structure outlined in
questions 1 -- 6 below.

\begin{questions}
\question[10]  \textbf{Problem} \droptotalpoints

Consult the list of variables provided in the dataset and choose a
topic to explore (if your dataset is called \verb+a+, typing
\verb+names(a)+ on the command line tells you the variable names you
have available; in Rstudio, you can see the details of a dataset which
you have read in the `environment' pane).

You should choose a broad overall topic, and then
write two specific questions to investigate.  You should also
provide a brief explanation (about 100-150 words) about why you think
these questions are interesting.

Two \emph{examples} of topics and questions are provided below
({\bf\em do not choose these examples!}).  The questions must be able
to be answered using data in the dataset.

Example 1: \\
Topic: What factors impact literacy?

Two specific questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do countries with a higher GDP also have a higher literacy rate? 
\item Does this relationship differ by geographic region? 
\end{itemize}

Example 2: \\
Topic: How do CO$_2$ emissions vary globally?

Two specific questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do countries with higher CO$_2$ emissions also have large agricultural sectors?
\item Do CO$_2$ emissions vary by geographic region? 
\end{itemize}

Marks will be awarded for a clear definition of the investigative
question/s and for a thoughtful explanation about why this question is
interesting.  Simply listing the questions will score about 4/10,
providing the questions are sensible and can be answered with the
dataset (otherwise a lower mark will be awarded).  The remaining 6/10
marks are awarded for the explanation.  Students who state appropriate
questions and provide a sensible and coherent explanation will get
full marks.

\question[5] \textbf{Plan} \droptotalpoints

What variables will be required to answer your questions?  Provide a
brief explanation (in your own words) about each of your chosen
variables. You are encouraged to refer to the World Bank website for
details about variables.  If you need to compute an additional
variable in order to answer one of your questions, the code used to do
this should be provided.

{\it Example: \\
%
\begin{tabular}{llll}
Short Name & Full Name  & Brief Description \\\hline

Female Literacy Rate &\parbox[t]{4cm}{Literacy rate, adult female (\% of females ages 15 and above)} & \parbox[t]{7cm}{The percentage of females, 15 years and above, who are able to read and write simple statements.}\\
Male Literacy Rate  & \ldots  &\ldots  \\
Literacy Rate  & \ldots   &\ldots  \\
GDP & \ldots  & \ldots  \\
%Geographic Region & \ldots  & \ldots &\ldots  \\
\end{tabular}
%Note: this example shows the explanation for one of the required variables. You should explain all of the variables that you will use.
}


\begin{solution}[5mm]
Marks will be awarded for correct identification of the appropriate variables and a clear explanation (similar to the "Brief Description") about the meaning of each variable.  The description should be written in the student's own words, not copied directly form the World Bank website.
%The world bank code is not important, though students should not be penalised for including it. 

Award 1 mark per variable up to a maximum of 5 marks. If students explain all relevant variables clearly and correctly, then full marks should be awarded.

\end{solution}


\question[5] \textbf{Data}  \droptotalpoints

Read the dataset into R and extract the data that you will need for
this analysis.  You can extract the columns by referring to them by
name or by number.  Provide the code that you use to do this.

\textit{Example:}
\begin{codeChunk}
\begin{codeIn}
#Read CSV file
allglobal <- read.csv(file.choose())

#Extract chosen columns using names
global <- allglobal[, c("Country", "Region", "GDP", "TaxRevenue")]

#Extract chosen columns using column numbers
global <- allglobal[, c(1, 3, 12, 30)]

#Inspect data
head(global)
\end{codeIn}
\end{codeChunk}

\begin{solution}[5mm]
Marks will be awarded if correct code is provided.  %Most students will get full marks here.
\end{solution}

\question[45] \textbf{Analysis} \droptotalpoints
Explore your two questions using appropriate summary statistics and graphs.
The following structure is recommended for each question:
\begin{itemize}
\item Clearly state the question being analysed (e.g. with a heading) %(\textit{1 mark})
\item Summary statistics and graphs.    In the example above, you might use R idiom such as

  \begin{itemize}
  \item  \verb+mean(global$GDP)+ or maybe \verb+median(global$GDP)+  (why the difference)?
  \item  \verb+hist(global$GDP)+
  \item \verb+boxplot(GDP~Region, data=global)+ \ldots although in this
    case you might be better off using logarithmic axes,
    \verb+boxplot(GDP~Region, data=global, log='y')+
  \end{itemize}
  

\item 50-150 words explaining the \textbf{key messages} of your summary statistics and graphs. % (\textit{8 marks})
\end{itemize}

Across the analysis of the two questions, you should include at
least~3 \textit{different} types of graphs and~4 \textit{different}
summary statistics.  Marks will only be awarded if the graphs, summary
statistics and explanations are correct and appropriate.

\begin{solution}[5mm]
There are 15 marks available for each of the 3 questions.  A mark out
of 15 should be provided for each question.  The allocation of the 15
marks is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item 1 mark for clearly stating the question
\item 5 marks for summary statistics and graphs
\item 9 marks for 150-250 words explaining the \textbf{key messages} of the summary statistics and graphs.
\end{itemize}
This means that if a student clearly indicates the question (e.g. using a heading) and creates sensible graphs and summary statistics but does not explain them, then they will get 6/15 for that question.

\MarkingNotes{

  The students are expected to apply the analysis from weeks~1
  and~2.  However if they have done this and also apply some other
  technique (e.g. maps), then credit should be given.  }

\MarkingNotes{Markers do not need to replicate the analysis that the
  students perform, but should "eyeball".}

The analysis should
\begin{itemize}
\item be appropriate for the question
\item be correct
\item follow a clear structure and provide insight
\item be explained clearly and correctly.
\end{itemize}

\end{solution}

\question[15] \textbf{Conclusion.} \droptotalpoints

Write one or two paragraphs (approximately 100-200 words) to summarise
your findings. You should answer your question by referring to the
appropriate analysis conducted in part 4. You should also mention
further analysis that could be conducted.
%Remember to relate your findings to the context!

\begin{solution}[5mm]
Marks will be awarded for clear and insightful comments.
\end{solution}

\question[10] \textbf{Critique}
\droptotalpoints

Choose two of the graphs that you used in part 4. For each graph,
explain why that type of graph was appropriate for the analysis that
you conducted (approximately 100 - 150 words total).


\begin{solution}[5mm]
5 marks per graph.

The graph which is being discussed should be clearly identified.  The
critique could mention like issues such as: the type of data (numeric
vs categorical) and the need to compare across categories, the range
of values etc.

\end{solution}

\question[10]  \textbf{Presentation and Grammar}
\droptotalpoints
Your report should be professionally presented and should be free of spelling and grammar errors, and all sources should be clearly referenced. %
Therefore, 10 marks will be allocated based on the overall presentation of your assignment.
    

%10 marks are awarded for presentation, style and grammar.

\begin{solution}[5mm] %\vspace{4cm}
Presentation marks include, but are not limited to: including a title
page, spelling, grammar, use of full sentences, use of mathematical
notation, clearly formatted answers, graphs with original aspect ratio
(e.g. not squashed), appropriate use of colour, correct referencing
etc.
\end{solution}

%\question
%\begin{parts}
%%\part It is often easier to work with a sample instead of an entire population. Given the larger dataset has 300 individuals, how would you create a random sample of 50?
%
%\part Can you find evidence in the sample dataset that either supports or contradicts this article? (Hint: classify the ages into age groups, and use some descriptive statistics to compare)
